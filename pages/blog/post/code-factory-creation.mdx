## Motivation for this whole thing?

I wanted to create a simple visual programming language that makes it easy to track data visually.

Things like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) show you statements, but they still operate with variables.
So they simplify creating programs, but reading/debugging _Scratch_ and _Python_ code is very similar.

It is closer to real computers. But I think that visualizing data flow could help with understanding those programs.
For example, debugging Factorio factories is relatively easy.
When you see coal somewhere where you do not expect it, you can follow that conveyor belt and find the issue.

## About this post

I wanted to share few interesting problems that I had to overcome.
[Factorio Friday Facts](https://www.factorio.com/blog/) mentioned a few problems, but there are many most Factorio players don't know.
