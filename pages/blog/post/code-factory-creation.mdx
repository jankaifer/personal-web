## Motivation for this whole thing?

I wanted to create a simple visual programming language that makes it easy to track data visually.

Things like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) show you statements, but they still operate with variables.
So they simplify creating programs, but reading/debugging _Scratch_ and _Python_ code is very similar.

It is closer to real computers. But I think that visualizing data flow could help with understanding those programs.
For example, debugging Factorio factories is relatively easy.
When you see coal somewhere where you do not expect it, you can follow that conveyor belt and find the issue.

## First architecture (Entity first)

At first I though I will create grid, entities.
And those entities will just move items to other entities (and modify them if needed).
I started with just conveyor belts.
Every tick I just looped over all entities and did their action.
The issue issue is that I looped through conveyor belts from left to right, so items move to the right significantly faster then they moved to the left (they have been moved two times in single tick when they moved between entities).

## Second architecture (Item first)

I could implemented workarounds for the first architecture, but I wanted to try something better.
My second architecture is item first.
I will track all items, with their position and what entities contain them. This will allow me to loop through all items, instead of all entities, which will make sure that I don't move single item twice.
