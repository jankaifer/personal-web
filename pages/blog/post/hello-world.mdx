Hey there, this is my first post here. I wanted to tell you a bit about this page. I made it with [Next](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I decided to use `mdx` for the content itself, which allows me to write posts in **markdown** and add cool simple widgets <DemoCounter/> or my Gravatar <MyAvatar size={20} round/> like this:

Or I can include my avatar like this :

```markdown
